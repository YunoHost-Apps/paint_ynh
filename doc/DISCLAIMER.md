This project aims to demonstrate modern web capabilities and Web Component-based application architectures on the example of a productivity app dinosaur: Paint.
All offline-capable and installable, just as [Progressive Web Apps](https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/) should be.

## PLEASE NOTE

This project is in an early state. Not all tools and actions are implemented right now. Your help and feedback are wanted!
